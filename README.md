## Monocular Depth Estimation for Aerial Images

Motivated by successes in depth estimation in autonomous driving and related areas, we investigate how state-of-the-art methods for MDE and 3D reconstruction are capable to build sufficiently accurate 3D information for aerial images. Moreover, we explore how we could improve possible baseline solution for better depth predictions.
We consider various loss functions, including composite losses, for encoder-decoder network architecture and GAN-manner training for sharper depth maps predictions.


On figure below some sample results are demonstrated.
